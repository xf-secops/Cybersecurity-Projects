test_pipeline.py

Tests the async ingestion pipeline across all 4 stages:
parsing, feature extraction, rule scoring, and dispatch

Uses a fakeredis-backed Pipeline with a results collector
callback. Validates that valid log lines flow end-to-end
producing a ScoredRequest with correct IP, method, 35-dim
feature vector, and LOW severity. Confirms malformed lines
are dropped without crashing, backpressure works with
maxsize=1 queues, stop() drains remaining items with all
tasks completing cleanly, and SQLi payloads score HIGH with
SQL_INJECTION rule match

Connects to:
  core/ingestion/pipeline - Pipeline, ScoredRequest
  core/detection/rules    - RuleEngine
