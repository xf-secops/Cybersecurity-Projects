Pydantic response models for the /threats endpoints

GeoInfo holds optional country, city, lat, lon from GeoIP
lookups. ThreatEventResponse is the full event schema with
UUID id, timestamps, request details, threat_score,
severity (Literal HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), component_scores,
geo info, matched_rules, model_version, and review status
(from_attributes enabled for ORM conversion). Threat
ListResponse wraps paginated items with total/limit/offset

Connects to:
  api/threats              - response_model for list and
                              detail endpoints
  services/threat_service  - _to_response builds these
